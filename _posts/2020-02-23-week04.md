This week I will be listing open source software projects I have reviewed as 
candidates for contributing to in the Open Source Software course's final 
project. 

### OpenCV


### ROS


### Jupyter
In class this past week the class was split into groups and my group was 
assigned to review the Jupyter project. Jupyter is a large project surrounding
"interactive computing" but is perhaps best known for its popular product,
Jupyter Notebook, of which I am a fan and a user. Allowing the combination of
markdown and code "cells" (which can be run in isolation), Jupyter Notebook 
offers a tool for experimentation and presentation, which is particularly 
useful in machine learning, data sciences and any science which involves data
processing and visualization. While perhaps not my first choice, it checks off
a number of the below criteria and is a leading contender.

- [x] Documents: critical documents present, readable, thorough
- [x] Project Tools/Technology: familiar language, no specialized knowledge 
needed, good issue tracker system, and communication
- [x] Project Activity: a healthy and manageable amount of activity
- [x] Responsive and Nice Community (Check out this example!)[https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/pull/5136]
